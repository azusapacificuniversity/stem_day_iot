APU STEM Day 2020 Internet of Things

### About
In this project, we explore the world of IoT by using ESP32 dev board and the Arduino IDE to monitor the temperature and the humidity of the environment, and to control the RGB LED from the mobile app.


### Hardware components:
- ESP32-pico-kit
- Wire Kit
- Breadboard
- 1x RGB LED
- 3x 100 Î© Resistors
- Micro USB Cable
- Humidity Sensor PCB
- Adafruit Light Sensor
- USB Power Bank (optional)

### Software Components:
- BLYNK mobile app 
- Arduino IDE
- You will need to install both of these libraries into the Arduino IDE for this project:
  - Blynk Library (follow method 1):
